> A small example to test DENTIST's workflow

Quickly test [DENTIST][dentist] with this example workflow. It uses part of the
_D. melanogaster_ reference assembly (dm6) and simulated reads to demonstrate
the workflow. The full source code of DENTIST is available at <https://github.com/a-ludi/dentist>.

Install
-------

Make sure you have [Snakemake][snakemake] (5.32.1 or later) and [Singularity][singularity] 3.5.x or later installed.

If you do not want to use Singularity, you have to follow the [software setup
of DENTIST][dentist-install]. But that is much more complicated and
error-prone.


[snakemake]: https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/v5.11.2/getting_started/installation.html
[singularity]: https://sylabs.io/guides/3.5/user-guide/quick_start.html
[dentist-install]: https://github.com/a-ludi/dentist#install


Usage
-------

First of all download the [test data and workflow][tarball], extract it to
your favorite working directory and switch to the `dentist-example` directory.

```sh
wget https://bds.mpi-cbg.de/hillerlab/DENTIST/dentist-example.v1.0.1.tar.gz
tar -xzf dentist-example.tar.gz
cd dentist-example
```

Execute the entire workflow on your *local machine* using `all` cores:

```sh
# run the workflow
snakemake --configfile=snakemake.yaml --use-singularity --cores=all

# validate the files
md5sum -c checksum.md5
```

Execute the workflow on a *SLURM cluster*:

```sh
mkdir -p "$HOME/.config/snakemake/slurm"
cp -v "profile-slurm.yaml" "$HOME/.config/snakemake/slurm/config.yaml"
snakemake --configfile=snakemake.yaml --use-singularity --profile=slurm

# validate the files
md5sum -c checksum.md5
```

If you want to run with a differnt cluster manager or in the cloud, please
read the advice in [DENTIST's README][dentist-cluster].

Troubleshooting
---------------

When executed on a single machine, `snakemake` will sometimes quit with an
`ProtectedOutputException` ([Snakemake bug report filed][sm-884]). You may try the follow snippet to get `snakemake`
back on track:

```sh
# make sure workdir exists to avoid errors with chmod
mkdir -p workdir
# keep track of the number of retries to avoid an infinite loop
RETRY=0
# try running snakemake as long as the gap-closed assembly was not created
# and we have retries left
while [[ ! -f "gap-closed.fasta" ]] && (( RETRY++ < 3 )); do
    # allow snakemake to overwrite protected output
    chmod -R u+w workdir
    # try snakemake...
    snakemake --configfile=snakemake.yaml --use-singularity --cores=all
done
```
